## Goals

- Introduce the field of biomathematics

- Provide context for the course content

- Gain overview of the course

Many of the ideas discussed in this lecture will be covered in much greater detail as the course proceeds. 

## Darwin's Quote

> Every new body of discovery is mathematical in form, because there is no other guidance we can have. Mathematics seems to endow one with something like a new sense. - Charles Darwin

## Oster and Wilson

> Like most biologists concerned with theory, we appreciate
that models do not themselves provide definitive answers to
biological questions. Mathematics is, after all, little more than
scaffolding upon which all manner of facts about the real
world can be arranged, hopefully into a more esthetic and
useful structure. Mathematical theory is the science of all
conceivable worlds. **The most important role models play in science is to help us to perceive a problem more clearly and to
generate thoughts that might not otherwise have occurred.** - Oster and Wilson (1978)


## Population Dynamics

## Fibonacci's Rabbits

> Someone had one pair of rabbits together in a certain enclosed place. One wishes to know how many are created from the pair in one year when it is the nature of them in a single month to bear another pair and in the second month those born to bear also. - Fibonacci *Liber abaci* (1202)

Note that if there is a pair of newborn rabbits at the beginning of the first month, this pair will not yet be fertile after one month and there will still be just one pair of rabbits at the beginning of the second month.

## Fibonacci Sequence

After some thought, one can see that the number of pairs of rabbits at the beginning of each month is given by the Fibonacci recurrence equation:

$$
x_{n+2} = x_{n+1} + x_n
$$

Starting with $x_0 = 1$ and $x_1 = 1$. You will show in the first homework that a solution to this recurrence is given by

$$
x_n = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^{n+1} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left( \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^{n+1} 
$$

## Dynamical Systems

- A [dynamical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system) is a system that evolves over time. Mathematically, dynamical systems are described by functions of time.

- Note that time can be discrete or continuous.

- Many biological processes are dynamical systems, or at least can be modeled as dynamical systems.

- The model for the reproduction of Fibonacci's rabbits is a dynamical system.

- Often, the evolution of a population can be modeled by relating the rate of change of the population to the current population size.
