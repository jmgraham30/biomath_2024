## Goals

- Introduce the field of biomathematics

- Provide context for the course content

- Gain overview of the course

## Darwin's Quote

> Every new body of discovery is mathematical in form, because there is no other guidance we can have. Mathematics seems to endow one with something like a new sense. - Charles Darwin

## Oster and Wilson

> Like most biologists concerned with theory, we appreciate
that models do not themselves provide definitive answers to
biological questions. Mathematics is, after all, little more than
scaffolding upon which all manner of facts about the real
world can be arranged, hopefully into a more esthetic and
useful structure. Mathematical theory is the science of all
conceivable worlds. **The most important role models play in science is to help us to perceive a problem more clearly and to
generate thoughts that might not otherwise have occurred.** - Oster and Wilson (1978)
