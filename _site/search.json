In order to fulfill the learning objectives for EPW Level II students will be asked to complete two writing intensive assignments. These are\n\na model report assignment,\nand a final project.\n\nDetails for these assignments are described below and additional guidelines are posted on the course learning management system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass attendance and active participation in class discussion is strongly encouraged. If absence is necessary, please inform the instructor and develop a plan to make up for missing content as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe course grade will be based on two in-class exams (totaling 50% and evenly distributed), approximately ten weekly homework assignments (20%), one model report (10%), and a final project (20%).\n\n\n\nLetter grades will be assigned based on the following scale:\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Letter grade scale.\n\n\nGrade Range\nLetter Grade\n\n\n\n\n94-100\nA\n\n\n90-93\nA-\n\n\n87-89\nB+\n\n\n83-86\nB\n\n\n80-82\nB-\n\n\n76-79\nC+\n\n\n72-75\nC\n\n\n69-71\nC-\n\n\n65-68\nD+\n\n\n60-64\nD\n\n\n&lt;60\nF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWork and research in Biomathematics requires professionals in the field to make use of digital technology. The primary uses of digital technology in Biomathematics is for producing and importing data, scientific computing, visualization of data and model-based simulations, and preparing written documents to explain mathematical results. Two of the most commonly used technological tools are R for scientific computing and \\(\\LaTeX\\) for written document preparation. Students in this course will be expected to use R, and \\(\\LaTeX\\). R can be installed to any platform via the downloads available here. R is best used with the integrative development environment RStudio which can be installed from here.\n\n\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) can be an effective tool in science. For example, AI-based programming assistants like GitHub Copilot or generative model platforms like ChatGPT now help programmers and developers to write better code in less time. Learning to use AI is essentially becoming a basic skill for the modern scientist. Because of this, I do not want to completely discourage the use of AI assistance.\nHowever, I ask that you avoid using AI platforms or tools in a manner that is inappropriate in the context of this course. This course teaches a variety of concepts, skills, and critical thinking. Using AI in such a way as to avoid learning, developing skills, or critical thinking is not appropriate. If you find yourself using AI to look up answers, search for complete solutions to problems, or things like this, then your use of AI is not acceptable. It might be helpful to think of AI as an analog to a calculator. If the goal of an assignment is for you to demonstrate that you can do a certain calculation, then using a calculator is not appropriate. On the other hand, if the goal of an assignment is for you to demonstrate that you can solve a problem for which a minor step involves doing a calculation, then using a calculator is okay. AI should be treated analogously.\nIn particular, it is expected that students will be able to explain independently and in detail what any line of code submitted as part of an assignment this semester does. Also, it is expected that students can explain independently and in detail the solution to any problem submitted as part of an assignment this semester.\nIf you have any doubts about your use of AI, then either ask the instructor if your use of AI is acceptable or just don’t use AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere will be weekly homework assignments. Assignments will be posted on the course learning management system and made up of problems relating to or extending the material covered in class discussions. Working problems is essential to learning the material and doing well on exams.\nDo not underestimate the value (and joy) of carefully working through homework problems.\n\n\n\nThe in-class exams are meant to assess 1) students’ understanding of the material covered in class and in homework assignments, 2) students’ understanding of the core concepts, 3) students’ problem solving abilities, and 4) students’ ability to think independently. Exam 1 is scheduled for March 6, and Exam 2 is scheduled for May 1. In writing the tests, I assume that you have been studying the material at least 6 hours per week outside of class.\n\n\n\nAs part of the required coursework for Topics in Biomathematics, students are required to submit a model report. The goal of this assignment is for students to read, understand, assess, and explain modeling results from a recently published paper in biology or biomathematics. The model report will make up 10% of the course grade. Students must submit at least two drafts of a model report. A model report should be three-five typed pages and prepared using \\(\\LaTeX\\) or R Markdown. The first draft is due March 25 and the final draft is due May 3. A set of guidelines for the model report is posted on the course learning management system.\n\n\n\nIt should be recognized that the mathematical techniques developed in class are applicable in broader situations than can be covered in lectures and homework. Thus, students are asked to individually explore a topic in biomathematics beyond what is covered in lecture by means of a final project. Final projects should be an 8-12 page manuscript typed using \\(\\LaTeX\\) or R Markdown, and students must submit at least two drafts of their written final projects. The final draft is due no later than 5:00pm on Wednesday May 15. All written and presented work must be original, explained in your own words, and use proper citation for works referenced.\nA set of guidelines for the final project is posted on the course learning management system. You must choose a topic for your final project and submit a one to two paragraph description of your proposed project along with at least two scholarly references to me no later than 5:00pm on March 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReasonable academic accommodations may be provided to students who submit relevant and current documentation of their disability. Students are encouraged to contact the Center for Teaching and Learning Excellence (CTLE) at disabilityservices@scranton.edu or (570) 941-4038 if they have or think they may have a disability and wish to determine eligibility for any accommodations. For more information, please visit http://www.scranton.edu/disabilities.\n\n\n\nThe Writing Center focuses on helping students become better writers. Consultants will work one-on-one with students to discuss students’ work and provide feedback at any stage of the writing process. Scheduling appointments early in the writing progress is encouraged.\nTo meet with a writing consultant, call (570) 941-6147 to schedule an appointment, or send an email with your available meeting times, the course for which you need assistance, and your phone number to: writing-center@scranton.edu. The Writing Center does offer online appointments for our distance learning students.\n\n\n\nEach student is expected to do their own work. It is also expected that each student respect and abide by the Academic Code of Honesty as set forth in the University of Scranton student handbook. Conduct that violates the Academic Code of Honesty includes plagiarism, duplicate submission of the same work, collusion, providing false information, unauthorized use of computers, theft and destruction of property, and unauthorized possession of tests and other materials. Steps taken in response to suspected violations may include a discussion with the instructor, an informal meeting with the dean of the college, and a hearing before the Academic Dishonesty Hearing Board. Students who are found to have violated the Code will ordinarily be assigned the grade F by the instructor and may face other sanctions. The complete Academic Code of Honesty is located on the University website at https://www.scranton.edu/academics/wml/acad-integ/acad-code-honesty.shtml.\n\n\n\nAs a faculty member, I am deeply invested in the well-being of each student I teach. I am here to assist you with your work in this course. Additionally, if you come to me with other non-course-related concerns, I will do my best to help. It is important for you to know that all faculty members are required to report incidents of sexual harassment or sexual misconduct involving students. This means that I cannot keep information about sexual harassment, sexual assault, sexual exploitation, intimate partner violence or stalking confidential if you share that information with me. I will keep the information as private as I can but am required to bring it to the attention of the University’s Title IX Coordinator, Elizabeth M. Garcia, or Deputy Title IX Coordinator, Diana M. Collins, who, in conversation with you, will explain available support, resources, and options. I will not report anything to anybody without first letting you know and discussing choices as to how to proceed. The University’s Counseling Center (570-941-7620) is available to you as a confidential resource; counselors (in the counseling center) do not have an obligation to report to the Title IX Coordinator.\n\n\n\nThe University is committed to providing an educational, residential, and working environment that is free from harassment and discrimination.

    "text": "Class attendance and active participation in class discussion is strongly encouraged. If absence is necessary, please inform the instructor and develop a plan to make up for missing content as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe course grade will be based on two in-class exams (totaling 50% and evenly distributed), approximately ten weekly homework assignments (20%), one model report (10%), and a final project (20%).\n\n\n\nLetter grades will be assigned based on the following scale:\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Letter grade scale.\n\n\nGrade Range\nLetter Grade\n\n\n\n\n94-100\nA\n\n\n90-93\nA-\n\n\n87-89\nB+\n\n\n83-86\nB\n\n\n80-82\nB-\n\n\n76-79\nC+\n\n\n72-75\nC\n\n\n69-71\nC-\n\n\n65-68\nD+\n\n\n60-64\nD\n\n\n&lt;60\nF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWork and research in Biomathematics requires professionals in the field to make use of digital technology. The primary uses of digital technology in Biomathematics is for producing and importing data, scientific computing, visualization of data and model-based simulations, and preparing written documents to explain mathematical results. Two of the most commonly used technological tools are R for scientific computing and \\(\\LaTeX\\) for written document preparation. Students in this course will be expected to use R, and \\(\\LaTeX\\). R can be installed to any platform via the downloads available here. R is best used with the integrative development environment RStudio which can be installed from here.\n\n\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) can be an effective tool in science. For example, AI-based programming assistants like GitHub Copilot or generative model platforms like ChatGPT now help programmers and developers to write better code in less time. Learning to use AI is essentially becoming a basic skill for the modern scientist. Because of this, I do not want to completely discourage the use of AI assistance.\nHowever, I ask that you avoid using AI platforms or tools in a manner that is inappropriate in the context of this course. This course teaches a variety of concepts, skills, and critical thinking. Using AI in such a way as to avoid learning, developing skills, or critical thinking is not appropriate. If you find yourself using AI to look up answers, search for complete solutions to problems, or things like this, then your use of AI is not acceptable. It might be helpful to think of AI as an analog to a calculator. If the goal of an assignment is for you to demonstrate that you can do a certain calculation, then using a calculator is not appropriate. On the other hand, if the goal of an assignment is for you to demonstrate that you can solve a problem for which a minor step involves doing a calculation, then using a calculator is okay. AI should be treated analogously.\nIn particular, it is expected that students will be able to explain independently and in detail what any line of code submitted as part of an assignment this semester does. Also, it is expected that students can explain independently and in detail the solution to any problem submitted as part of an assignment this semester.\nIf you have any doubts about your use of AI, then either ask the instructor if your use of AI is acceptable or just don’t use AI."

    "text": "There will be weekly homework assignments. Assignments will be posted on the course learning management system and made up of problems relating to or extending the material covered in class discussions. Working problems is essential to learning the material and doing well on exams.\nDo not underestimate the value (and joy) of carefully working through homework problems.\n\n\n\nThe in-class exams are meant to assess 1) students’ understanding of the material covered in class and in homework assignments, 2) students’ understanding of the core concepts, 3) students’ problem solving abilities, and 4) students’ ability to think independently. Exam 1 is scheduled for March 6, and Exam 2 is scheduled for May 1. In writing the tests, I assume that you have been studying the material at least 6 hours per week outside of class.\n\n\n\nAs part of the required coursework for Topics in Biomathematics, students are required to submit a model report. The goal of this assignment is for students to read, understand, assess, and explain modeling results from a recently published paper in biology or biomathematics. The model report will make up 10% of the course grade. Students must submit at least two drafts of a model report. A model report should be three-five typed pages and prepared using \\(\\LaTeX\\) or R Markdown. The first draft is due March 25 and the final draft is due May 3. A set of guidelines for the model report is posted on the course learning management system.\n\n\n\nIt should be recognized that the mathematical techniques developed in class are applicable in broader situations than can be covered in lectures and homework. Thus, students are asked to individually explore a topic in biomathematics beyond what is covered in lecture by means of a final project. Final projects should be an 8-12 page manuscript typed using \\(\\LaTeX\\) or R Markdown, and students must submit at least two drafts of their written final projects. The final draft is due no later than 5:00pm on Wednesday May 15. All written and presented work must be original, explained in your own words, and use proper citation for works referenced.\nA set of guidelines for the final project is posted on the course learning management system. You must choose a topic for your final project and submit a one to two paragraph description of your proposed project along with at least two scholarly references to me no later than 5:00pm on March 1."
