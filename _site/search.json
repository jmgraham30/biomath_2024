Herald, Bulletin of mathematical biology, 72, (2010) pp. 765-779.\n\n\n\n\nOccasionally in the course we will make reference to topics from the following recommended texts. These books are not required for the course and students are not expected to purchase them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Course in Mathematical Biology: Quantitative Modeling with Mathematical and Computational Methods by Gerda de Vries, Thomas Hillen, Mark Lewis, Johannes Müller, and Birgitt Schönfisch. ISBN: 978-0-89871-612-2.\nA Course in Mathematical Biology (ACMB) covers common approaches to the mathematical modeling of biological systems. We will study select topics from the book based on the interests of the students and instructor, and as time permits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiology in Time and Space: A Partial Differential Equation Modeling Approach by James P. Keener, ISBN: 978-1-4704-5428-9\nBiology in Time and Space (BTS) covers common approaches to the mathematical modeling of biological systems using differential equations. We will study select topics from the book based on the interests of the students and instructor, and as time permits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolving Differential Equations in R by Karline Soetaert, Jeff Cash, and Francesca Mazzia. ISBN: 978-3-642-28069-6.\nThis book covers practical aspects of using R in solving numerically the types of differential equations we will study in this course as mathematical models for biological systems.\nElectronic access to Solving Differential Equations in R is available through the Weinberg Memorial Library. Access the book. See also the article Solving Differential Equations in R.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you may find the Spring 2022 MATH 463 Course Page: https://topicsinbiomath.netlify.app/ useful. It contains links to course notes and other materials from when the course was taught in Spring 2022.\n\n\n\nTo go deeper into the topics covered in this course, the following books are recommended. These books are not required for the course and students are not expected to purchase them. However, these may be valuable sources for topics for a final project or for further study.\n\n\n\n\nMathematical Biology by J.D. Murray, ISBN: 978-0-387-95223-9\nMathematical Biology is an influential text covering a wide range of topics in mathematical biology. The most recent third edition of the book consists of two volumes, see the Wikipedia article on the book for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Introduction to Modeling Neuronal Dynamics by Christoph Börgers, ISBN: 978-3-319-84585-2\nAn Introduction to Modeling Neuronal Dynamics covers the basics of mathematical and computational neuroscience. In particular, the book covers the Hodgkin-Huxley model of the action potential, the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, and the Wilson-Cowan model of interacting populations of neurons. The book also covers some mathematical techniques for analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems models for neuroscience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Introduction to Undergraduate Research in Computational and Mathematical Biology From Birdsongs to Viscosities edited by Hannah Callender Highlander, Alex Capaldi, and Carrie Diaz Eaton, ISBN: 978-3-030-33647-9\nAn Introduction to Undergraduate Research in Computational and Mathematical Biology From Birdsongs to Viscosities contains chapters covering a variety of topics in current research in computational and mathematical biology meant to engage undergraduate students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDynamics of cancer by Natalia Komarova and Dominik Woodarz, ISBN: 978-981-4566-36-0\nDynamics of cancer aims to provide an introduction to mathematical models that describe the dynamics of tumor growth and the evolution of tumor cells. The book has a strong evolutionary component and reflects the viewpoint that cancer can be understood rationally through a combination of mathematical and biological tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWork and research in Biomathematics requires students and professionals in the field to make use of computing and digital technology. The primary uses of digital technology in Biomathematics is for producing and importing data, scientific computing, visualization of data and model-based simulations, and preparing written documents to present scientific results. Students in this course will be expected to make some use of computing and technical writing. Two commonly used technological tools are R for scientific computing and \\(\\LaTeX\\) for technical writing. This course will emphasize the use of R which can be installed to any platform via the downloads available here. R is best used with the integrative development environment RStudio which can be installed from here. Further, RStudio facilitates the integration of code and technical writing in \\(\\LaTeX\\) via the Quarto system. The progamming languages Julia and Python are also commonly used in scientific computing and are also available for free.\nThe course website contains reference pages for scientific computing for Biomathematics using R, Julia, and Python.\n\nView the R reference\nView the Julia reference\nView the Python reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA study of discrete and continuous mathematical models in biology. Topics include: population dynamics of single species and interacting species, infectious diseases, population genetics, and cell populations with tumor modeling.\n\n\n\nThe prerequisites for this course is MATH 341 Differential Equations and MATH 351 Linear Algebra. Specifically, the students are expected to have a solid foundation in calculus, and a working knowledge of elementary linear algebra and basic ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Some topics from probability and statistics will be used, but these will be reviewed as needed. Additionally, some topics from linear algebra and differential equations may be reviewed or presented from a different perspective than MATH 341 or MATH 351. No background in programming is assumed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Course objectives and assessment.\n\n\nAfter taking this course, the student should be able to:\nMethods of assessment\n\n\n\n\nUse mathematical tools from calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra to analyze foundational mathematical models arising in the life sciences.\nHomework assignments and in-class written exams.\n\n\nInterpret the meaning of mathematical equations or models representing various biological processes.\nHomework assignments, model reports, and final project.\n\n\nUtilize computing tools such as R to analyze and interpret data-driven mathematical models.\nHomework assignments, model reports, and final project.\n\n\nCommunicate effectively in writing their work in applying the techniques of applied mathematics to problems arising in the life sciences.\nHomework, model reports, and final project consisting of a written paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe student learning objectives of this course are linked with the Mathematics Program Learning Outcome\n\n“Demonstrate competence in analytical and critical reasoning.”\n“Demonstrate college-level knowledge in applied mathematics.”\n\n\n\n\nMATH 463 has been designated an EPW Level II course. In order to fulfill the learning objectives for EPW Level II students will be asked to complete two writing intensive assignments. These are\n\na model report assignment,\nand a final project.\n\nDetails for these assignments are described below and additional guidelines are posted on the course learning management system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass attendance and active participation in class discussion is strongly encouraged. If absence is necessary, please inform the instructor and develop a plan to make up for missing content as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe course grade will be based on two in-class exams (totaling 50% and evenly distributed), approximately ten weekly homework assignments (15%), one model report (10%), and a final project (25%).\n\n\n\nLetter grades will be assigned based on the following scale:\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Letter grade scale.\n\n\nGrade Range\nLetter Grade\n\n\n\n\n94-100\nA\n\n\n90-93\nA-\n\n\n87-89\nB+\n\n\n83-86\nB\n\n\n80-82\nB-\n\n\n76-79\nC+\n\n\n72-75\nC\n\n\n69-71\nC-\n\n\n65-68\nD+\n\n\n60-64\nD\n\n\n&lt;60\nF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) can be an effective tool in science. For example, AI-based programming assistants like GitHub Copilot or generative model platforms like ChatGPT now help programmers to write better code in less time. Learning to use AI effectively and responsibly is quickly becoming a basic skill for the modern scientist. Because of this, I do not want to completely discourage the use of AI assistance.\nHowever, I ask that you avoid using AI platforms or tools in a manner that is inappropriate in the context of this course. This course teaches a variety of concepts, skills, and critical thinking. Using AI in such a way as to avoid learning, developing skills, or critical thinking is not appropriate. If you find yourself using AI to look up answers, search for complete solutions to problems, or things like this, then your use of AI is not acceptable. It might be helpful to think of AI as an analog to a calculator. If the goal of an assignment is for you to demonstrate that you can do a certain calculation, then using a calculator is not appropriate. On the other hand, if the goal of an assignment is for you to demonstrate that you can solve a problem for which a minor step involves doing a calculation, then using a calculator is okay. AI use in the context of this course should be treated analogously.\nIn particular, it is expected that students will be able to explain independently and in detail any work or ideas on assignments this semester. Also, it is expected that students can explain independently and in detail the solution to any problem submitted as part of an assignment this semester.\nIf you have any doubts about your use of AI, then either ask the instructor if your use of AI is acceptable or just don’t use AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere will be weekly homework assignments. Assignments will be posted on the course learning management system and made up of problems relating to or extending the material covered in class discussions. Working problems is essential to learning the material and doing well on exams.\nDo not underestimate the value (and joy) of carefully working through homework problems.\n\n\n\nThe in-class exams are meant to assess 1) students’ understanding of the material covered in class and in homework assignments, 2) students’ understanding of the core concepts, 3) students’ problem solving abilities, and 4) students’ ability to think independently. Exam 1 is scheduled for March 6, and Exam 2 is scheduled for May 1. In writing the tests, I assume that you have been studying the material at least 6 hours per week outside of class.\n\n\n\nAs part of the required coursework for Topics in Biomathematics, students are asked to submit a model report. The goal of this assignment is for students to read, understand, assess, and explain modeling results from a recently published paper in theoretical or quantitative biology or biomathematics. The model report will make up 10% of the course grade. Students must submit at least two drafts of a model report. A model report should be four to five typed pages and prepared using \\(\\LaTeX\\) or R Markdown. The first draft is due March 25 and the final draft is due May 3. A set of guidelines for the model report can be found on the course learning management system.\n\n\n\nIt should be recognized that the mathematical techniques developed in class are applicable in broader situations than can be covered in lectures and homework. Thus, students are asked to individually explore a topic in biomathematics beyond what is covered in lecture by means of a final project. Final projects should be an 8-12 page manuscript prepared using \\(\\LaTeX\\) or R Markdown, and students must submit at least two drafts of their written final projects. The final draft is due no later than 5:00pm on Wednesday May 15. All written and presented work must be original, explained in your own words, and use proper citation for works referenced.\nA set of guidelines for the final project is posted on the course learning management system. You must choose a topic for your final project and submit a one to two paragraph description of your proposed project along with at least two scholarly references to me no later than 5:00pm on March 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 1 (01/22-01/26): Introduction to Biomathematics\nWeek 2 (01/29-02/02): Dimensional Analysis and Scaling\nWeek 3 (02/05-02/09): One-Dimensional Dynamics and Introduction to Population Dynamics\nWeek 4 (02/12-02/16): Bifurcation Theory and Compartment Models\nWeek 5 (02/19-02/23): SIR Type Models and The Chemostat Bio-reactor\nWeek 6 (02/26-03/01): Functional Forms\nWeek 7 (03/04-03/08): Exam 1\nWeek 8 (03/11-03/15): Spring Break\nWeek 9 (03/18-03/22): Two-Dimensional Dynamics and Phase Plane Analysis\nWeek 10 (03/25-03/29): Mass Action and Reaction Kinetics/ Easter Break; Model Report Draft 1 Due\nWeek 11 (04/01-04/05): Easter Break/ Mass Action and Reaction Kinetics\nWeek 12 (04/08-04/12): Mathematical Physiology\nWeek 13 (04/15-04/19): Perturbation Methods\nWeek 14 (04/22-04/26): Additional Topics\nWeek 15 (04/29-05/03): Exam 2; Model Report Final Draft Due\nWeek 16 (05/06-05/10): Dead Week\nWeek 17 (05/13-05/17): Final Exams; Final Project Due\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Important Dates\n\n\nEvent\nDate\n\n\n\n\nClasses begin\nWednesday, January 24\n\n\nLast day to add classes\nTuesday, January 30\n\n\nLast day for 100% tution refund\nFriday, February 2\n\n\nLast day to drop with no grade\nFriday, February 23\n\n\nExam 1\nWednesday, March 6\n\n\nLast day of class before spring break\nFriday, March 8\n\n\nClasses resume after spring break\nMonday, March 18\n\n\nSemester Midpoint\nWednesday, March 20\n\n\nLast day of class before Easter break\nWednesday, March 27\n\n\nClasses resume after Easter\nTuesday, April 2\n\n\nLast day to withdraw with W grade\nFriday, April 12\n\n\nExam 2\nWednesday, May 1\n\n\nLast day of class\nFriday, May 10\n\n\nFinal exams begin\nMonday, May 13\n\n\nFinal exams end\nFriday, May 17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReasonable academic accommodations may be provided to students who submit relevant and current documentation of their disability.

Consultants will work one-on-one with students to discuss students’ work and provide feedback at any stage of the writing process. Scheduling appointments early in the writing progress is encouraged.\nTo meet with a writing consultant, call (570) 941-6147 to schedule an appointment, or send an email with your available meeting times, the course for which you need assistance, and your phone number to: writing-center@scranton.edu. The Writing Center does offer online appointments for our distance learning students.\n\n\n\nEach student is expected to do their own work. It is also expected that each student respect and abide by the Academic Code of Honesty as set forth in the University of Scranton student handbook. Conduct that violates the Academic Code of Honesty includes plagiarism, duplicate submission of the same work, collusion, providing false information, unauthorized use of computers, theft and destruction of property, and unauthorized possession of tests and other materials. Steps taken in response to suspected violations may include a discussion with the instructor, an informal meeting with the dean of the college, and a hearing before the Academic Dishonesty Hearing Board. Students who are found to have violated the Code will ordinarily be assigned the grade F by the instructor and may face other sanctions. The complete Academic Code of Honesty is located on the University website at https://www.scranton.edu/academics/wml/acad-integ/acad-code-honesty.shtml.\n\n\n\nAs a faculty member, I am deeply invested in the well-being of each student I teach. I am here to assist you with your work in this course. Additionally, if you come to me with other non-course-related concerns, I will do my best to help. It is important for you to know that all faculty members are required to report incidents of sexual harassment or sexual misconduct involving students. This means that I cannot keep information about sexual harassment, sexual assault, sexual exploitation, intimate partner violence or stalking confidential if you share that information with me. I will keep the information as private as I can but am required to bring it to the attention of the University’s Title IX Coordinator, Elizabeth M. Garcia, or Deputy Title IX Coordinator, Diana M. Collins, who, in conversation with you, will explain available support, resources, and options. I will not report anything to anybody without first letting you know and discussing choices as to how to proceed. The University’s Counseling Center (570-941-7620) is available to you as a confidential resource; counselors (in the counseling center) do not have an obligation to report to the Title IX Coordinator.\n\n\n\nThe University is committed to providing an educational, residential, and working environment that is free from harassment and discrimination. Members of the University community, applicants for employment or admissions, guests, and visitors have the right to be free from harassment or discrimination based on race, color, religion, ancestry, gender, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, genetic information, national origin, veteran status, or any other status protected by applicable law.\nStudents who believe they have been subject to harassment or discrimination based on any of the above class of characteristics, or experience sexual harassment, sexual misconduct or gender discrimination should contact Elizabeth M. Garcia, Title IX Coordinator, (570) 941-6645 elizabeth.garcia2@scranton.edu, Deputy Title IX Coordinators Diana M.

Access the book. See also the article Solving Differential Equations in R.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you may find the Spring 2022 MATH 463 Course Page: https://topicsinbiomath.netlify.app/ useful. It contains links to course notes and other materials from when the course was taught in Spring 2022.\n\n\n\nTo go deeper into the topics covered in this course, the following books are recommended. These books are not required for the course and students are not expected to purchase them. However, these may be valuable sources for topics for a final project or for further study.\n\n\n\n\nMathematical Biology by J.D. Murray, ISBN: 978-0-387-95223-9\nMathematical Biology is an influential text covering a wide range of topics in mathematical biology. The most recent third edition of the book consists of two volumes, see the Wikipedia article on the book for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Introduction to Modeling Neuronal Dynamics by Christoph Börgers, ISBN: 978-3-319-84585-2\nAn Introduction to Modeling Neuronal Dynamics covers the basics of mathematical and computational neuroscience. In particular, the book covers the Hodgkin-Huxley model of the action potential, the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, and the Wilson-Cowan model of interacting populations of neurons.

The primary uses of digital technology in Biomathematics is for producing and importing data, scientific computing, visualization of data and model-based simulations, and preparing written documents to present scientific results. Students in this course will be expected to make some use of computing and technical writing. Two commonly used technological tools are R for scientific computing and \\(\\LaTeX\\) for technical writing. This course will emphasize the use of R which can be installed to any platform via the downloads available here. R is best used with the integrative development environment RStudio which can be installed from here. Further, RStudio facilitates the integration of code and technical writing in \\(\\LaTeX\\) via the Quarto system. The progamming languages Julia and Python are also commonly used in scientific computing and are also available for free.\nThe course website contains reference pages for scientific computing for Biomathematics using R, Julia, and Python.\n\nView the R reference\nView the Julia reference\nView the Python reference"

For example, AI-based programming assistants like GitHub Copilot or generative model platforms like ChatGPT now help programmers to write better code in less time. Learning to use AI effectively and responsibly is quickly becoming a basic skill for the modern scientist. Because of this, I do not want to completely discourage the use of AI assistance.\nHowever, I ask that you avoid using AI platforms or tools in a manner that is inappropriate in the context of this course. This course teaches a variety of concepts, skills, and critical thinking. Using AI in such a way as to avoid learning, developing skills, or critical thinking is not appropriate. If you find yourself using AI to look up answers, search for complete solutions to problems, or things like this, then your use of AI is not acceptable. It might be helpful to think of AI as an analog to a calculator. If the goal of an assignment is for you to demonstrate that you can do a certain calculation, then using a calculator is not appropriate. On the other hand, if the goal of an assignment is for you to demonstrate that you can solve a problem for which a minor step involves doing a calculation, then using a calculator is okay. AI use in the context of this course should be treated analogously.\nIn particular, it is expected that students will be able to explain independently and in detail any work or ideas on assignments this semester. Also, it is expected that students can explain independently and in detail the solution to any problem submitted as part of an assignment this semester.\nIf you have any doubts about your use of AI, then either ask the instructor if your use of AI is acceptable or just don’t use AI."

    "text": "There will be weekly homework assignments. Assignments will be posted on the course learning management system and made up of problems relating to or extending the material covered in class discussions. Working problems is essential to learning the material and doing well on exams.\nDo not underestimate the value (and joy) of carefully working through homework problems.\n\n\n\nThe in-class exams are meant to assess 1) students’ understanding of the material covered in class and in homework assignments, 2) students’ understanding of the core concepts, 3) students’ problem solving abilities, and 4) students’ ability to think independently. Exam 1 is scheduled for March 6, and Exam 2 is scheduled for May 1. In writing the tests, I assume that you have been studying the material at least 6 hours per week outside of class.\n\n\n\nAs part of the required coursework for Topics in Biomathematics, students are asked to submit a model report. The goal of this assignment is for students to read, understand, assess, and explain modeling results from a recently published paper in theoretical or quantitative biology or biomathematics. The model report will make up 10% of the course grade. Students must submit at least two drafts of a model report. A model report should be four to five typed pages and prepared using \\(\\LaTeX\\) or R Markdown. The first draft is due March 25 and the final draft is due May 3. A set of guidelines for the model report can be found on the course learning management system.\n\n\n\nIt should be recognized that the mathematical techniques developed in class are applicable in broader situations than can be covered in lectures and homework. Thus, students are asked to individually explore a topic in biomathematics beyond what is covered in lecture by means of a final project. Final projects should be an 8-12 page manuscript prepared using \\(\\LaTeX\\) or R Markdown, and students must submit at least two drafts of their written final projects. The final draft is due no later than 5:00pm on Wednesday May 15. All written and presented work must be original, explained in your own words, and use proper citation for works referenced.\nA set of guidelines for the final project is posted on the course learning management system. You must choose a topic for your final project and submit a one to two paragraph description of your proposed project along with at least two scholarly references to me no later than 5:00pm on March 1."

    "text": "Overview\nScientific computing software plays a major role in biomathematics for many reasons some of which include:\n\nThe complexity of biological systems leads to models or equations that are difficult to work with analytically but can be handled reasonably well by numerical methods.\nThe need to synthesize theoretical models and data from experiments.\nPlots and other visualizations are important for understanding and communicating scientific ideas and results.\nComputing allows us to use theoretical models to conduct experiments in silico that would be difficult or impossible to conduct otherwise.\n\nThus, this course will make use of scientific computing software. Three commonly used free and open-source languages for scientific computing in biomathematics are R, Julia, and Python. In this course, we will mostly use R, but it’s worth knowing at least a little about scientific computing in all three languages as each of them has its own strengths and weaknesses in the context of scientific computing for biomathematics. The goal is not to teach you to become an expert in any of these languages, but rather to become familiar with how to use them to solve some basic problems in biomathematics. Thus, this document is more of a reference than a tutorial.\nThis page will focus on Julia. The other two languages have their own pages:\n\nR for Biomathematics\nPython for Biomathematics\n\nEach of these pages will have a similar structure to this one. We do not provide details on or even an introduction to the basics of programming or the structure of any of the languages. There are many resources available for learning these things. Instead, we focus on providing some concise examples of the use of these languages for scientific computing in biomathematics. The hope is that the reader will be able to copy and modify these examples to solve their own problems.\nThe section titles listed in the table of contents for the page should indicate the topics or types of problems we provide examples for. For some of the more involved code, we provide links to additional webpages that provide more details. In some cases, we provide links to potentially helpful videos or web sites where the reader can learn more."

    "text": "Partial Differential Equations\nPartial differential equations (PDEs) generalize ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to allow for solutions that are functions of two or more variables. Typically, in the context of biomathematics, the variables represent time and spatial coordinates. Thus, PDEs allow us to model how a biological systems change in both time and space. The examples we will see in this course will mostly be convection-diffusion type equations or systems of such equations. These PDEs have the form\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot \\left( D \\nabla c - {\\bf v} c \\right) + R\n\\]\nSpecial cases include diffusion equations of which the heat equation\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D \\nabla^2 c\n\\]\nis a special case. In one dimension, the heat equation is\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2}\n\\]\nOften, in order to have a complete model, we need to specify both initial conditions and boundary conditions for the PDE problem. For example in the case of the one-dimensional heat equation, we might specify the initial temperature distribution \\(c(x,0)\\) and the values of the flux at the boundaries, that is \\(\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}(0,t)\\) and \\(\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}(L,t)\\) for \\(t&gt;0\\).\nThere are many approaches to the numerical solution of PDEs. We will focus on the method of lines which discretizes the spatial domain and then uses ODE solvers such as those we previously described to solve the resulting system of ODEs.\nFor Python, the py-pde module is available to facilitate the implementation of the method of lines for PDEs. The following links illustrate the use of this package:\n\nNumerical solution of the heat equation in Python - this page demonstrates using the py-pde module to obtain and visualize numerical solutions for the heat equation in one dimension."

    "text": "Random Variables\nWhile MATH 463 primarily focuses on deterministic models, stochastic models are also important in biomathematics, see for example (Allen 2011). We won’t cover stochastic models in the course but will have a few occasions where it will be useful to add some stochasticity to a deterministic model. Many different probability distributions are available in R. Primarily, we focus on sampling from a distribution and accessing the probability density or probability mass function for a distribution. Further, we will demonstrate the main functions for the normal distribution and the binomial distribution. Working with other distributions is handled similarly. Additional details, examples, and applications will be covered in course lectures.\nFor every distribution that is implemented in R, there are four functions that can be used to access the distribution:\n\nd&lt;dist&gt;: the probability density function (PDF) for continuous distributions or the probability mass function (PMF) for discrete distributions\np&lt;dist&gt;: the cumulative distribution function (CDF), which is the integral of the PDF or PMF\nq&lt;dist&gt;: the quantile function, which is the inverse of the CDF\nr&lt;dist&gt;: a random number generator (RNG) that samples from the distribution\n\n\nBinomial Distributions\nRecall that a binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of successes in a sequence of \\(n\\) independent experiments, each asking a yes–no question, and each with its own Boolean-valued outcome: success/yes/true/one (with probability \\(p\\)) or failure/no/false/zero (with probability \\(q = 1 - p\\)). A single success/failure experiment is also called a Bernoulli trial or Bernoulli experiment and a sequence of outcomes is called a Bernoulli process; for a single trial, i.e., \\(n = 1\\), the binomial distribution is a Bernoulli distribution. The probability of outcomes for a binomial random variable are given by the binomial probability mass function for:\n\\[\nf(k,n,p) = \\Pr(k;n,p) = \\Pr(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}\n\\]\nwhere \\(k\\) is the number of successes, \\(n\\) is the number of trials, and \\(p\\) is the probability of success in each trial.\nLet’s generate a random sample from a binomial distribution with \\(n = 10\\) and \\(p = 0.5\\):\n\nrbinom(5,10,0.5)\n\n[1] 5 7 4 3 3\n\n\nLet’s generate a large number of samples and plot a histogram of the results, see Figure 7.\n\n# plot histogram\ntibble(x=rbinom(1000,10,0.5)) |&gt;\nggplot(aes(x = x)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = \"black\", fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 8, y = 200, label = TeX(\"$n=10, p=0.5$\"), size = 5) +\n  theme_bw(base_size=13) +\n  labs(x = \"x\", y = \"Count\", \n       title = \"Binomial Distribution Samples\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Histogram of 1000 samples from a binomial distribution with \\(n = 10\\) and \\(p = 0.5\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can work with the probability mass function as follows:\n\ndbinom(4,10,0.5)\n\n[1] 0.2050781\n\n\nFigure 8 displays the probability mass function for a binomial random variable with \\(n=10\\) and \\(p=0.5\\).\n\n# plot pmf\ntibble(x=0:10) |&gt;\nggplot(aes(x = x, y = dbinom(x,10,0.5))) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 9, y = 0.2, label = TeX(\"$n=10, p=0.5$\"), size = 5) +\n  theme_bw(base_size=13) +\n  labs(x = \"Number of Successes\", y = \"Probability\", \n       title = \"Binomial Distribution PMF\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Probability mass function for a binomial random variable with \\(n=10\\) and \\(p=0.5\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormal Distributions\nRecall that a normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean. In graph form, normal distribution will appear as a bell curve. Normal distributions are extremely important in statistics and are often used in the natural and social sciences to represent real-valued random variables whose distributions are not known. A random variable with a Gaussian distribution is said to be normally distributed and is called a normal deviate. The probability that a normal random variable with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^{2}\\) has a value between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is given by the definite integral of a normal density function defined by:\n\\[\nf(x \\mid \\mu, \\sigma^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\n\\]\nThe parameter \\(\\sigma\\) is called the standard deviation.\nLet’s generate a random sample from a normal distribution with \\(\\mu = 5\\) and \\(\\sigma = 1.5\\):\n\nrnorm(10,5,1.5)\n\n [1] 2.102162 4.831484 8.070078 6.516743 3.859589 1.692009 5.242060 4.156023\n [9] 6.459276 3.127634\n\n\nLet’s generate a large number of samples and plot a histogram of the results, see Figure 9.\n\n# plot histogram\ntibble(x=rnorm(1000,5,1.5)) |&gt;\nggplot(aes(x = x)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = \"black\", fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 9, y = 200, label = TeX(\"$\\\\mu=5, \\\\sigma=1.5$\"), size = 5) +\n  theme_bw(base_size=13) +\n  labs(x = \"x\", y = \"Count\", \n       title = \"Normal Distribution Samples\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Histogram of 1000 samples from a normal distribution with \\(\\mu = 5\\) and \\(\\sigma = 1.5\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, let’s plot the probability density function for a normal distribution with \\(\\mu = 5\\) and \\(\\sigma = 1.5\\), see Figure 10.\n\n# plot pdf\ntibble(x=c(0,10)) |&gt;\nggplot(aes(x = x)) +\n  geom_function(fun=function(x){dnorm(x,5,1.5)},color = \"steelblue\",linewidth=1) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 9, y = 0.2, label = TeX(\"$\\\\mu=5, \\\\sigma=1.5$\"), size = 5) +\n  theme_bw(base_size=13) +\n  labs(x = \"x\", y = \"Probability\", \n       title = \"Normal Distribution PDF\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Probability density function for a normal distribution with \\(\\mu = 5\\) and \\(\\sigma = 1.5\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a random variable \\(X \\sim \\text{Norm}(\\mu=5,\\sigma=1.5)\\), the probability that \\(X\\) is between \\(3\\) and \\(7\\) is given by:\n\\[\nP(3 \\leq X \\leq 7) = \\int_{3}^{7} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\cdot 1.5^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x-5)^2}{2 \\cdot 1.5^2}\\right) dx\n\\]\nwhich we can compute in R using:\n\npnorm(7,5,1.5) - pnorm(3,5,1.5)\n\n[1] 0.8175776\n\n\nThus, the area under the normal density curve with \\(\\mu=5\\) and \\(\\sigma=1.5\\) between \\(3\\) and \\(7\\) is about 0.82."

We won’t cover stochastic models in the course but will have a few occasions where it will be useful to add some stochasticity to a deterministic model. Many different probability distributions are available in Python through the scipy.stats module. In this section, we introduce some functions associated with distributions and random sampling. Primarily, we focus on sampling from a distribution and accessing the probability density or probability mass function for a distribution. Further, we will demonstrate the main functions for the normal distribution and the binomial distribution. Working with other distributions is handled similarly. Additional details, examples, and applications will be covered in course lectures.\n\nBinomial Distributions\nRecall that a binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of successes in a sequence of \\(n\\) independent experiments, each asking a yes–no question, and each with its own Boolean-valued outcome: success/yes/true/one (with probability \\(p\\)) or failure/no/false/zero (with probability \\(q = 1 - p\\)). A single success/failure experiment is also called a Bernoulli trial or Bernoulli experiment and a sequence of outcomes is called a Bernoulli process; for a single trial, i.e., \\(n = 1\\), the binomial distribution is a Bernoulli distribution. The probability of outcomes for a binomial random variable are given by the binomial probability mass function for:\n\\[\nf(k,n,p) = \\Pr(k;n,p) = \\Pr(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}\n\\]\nwhere \\(k\\) is the number of successes, \\(n\\) is the number of trials, and \\(p\\) is the probability of success in each trial.\nLet’s work with a binomial distribution in Python.

    "text": "Julia\nThe Julia language is at the forefront of high-performance numerical and scientific computing (Bezanson et al. 2017). You can learn more about the history of Julia here.\n\nFunctions and Packages\nAs in R, most of the algorithms and methods we will want to use in solving problems in biomathematics are implemented as functions in Julia. Base Julia contains a number of functions including many that are useful for scientific computing. For example, base Julia contains a function sin that implements the mathematical function \\(\\sin(x)\\). It is called as follows:\n\nsin(pi/4.0)\n\n0.7071067811865475\n\n\nHowever, most of the functions we will use are not in base Julia but rather are contained in packages. A package is a collection of functions and other objects that can be loaded into Julia and used. Julia comes with a built-in package manager that allows you to install and manage packages. You can learn about the package manager through either the package manager documentation of the following video:\n\nManaging Packages in Julia YouTube video, watch video on YouTube.\n\n\n\n\nEnvinronment Setup\nOne thing that is a little different working in Julia (and also Python) compared to R is that it’s common practice to utilize a separate environment for each project. This is done to avoid conflicts between packages and package versions that might be used in different projects. Basically, a project consists of a folder that contains files named Project.toml and Manifest.toml. You can learn the details about Julia environments by reading the environment documentation or get a short tutorial by watching the following video:\n\nJulia environments YouTube video, watch video on YouTube.\n\n\nThe DrWatson.jl package provides a convenient way to manage projects and environments in Julia. You can learn more about DrWatson.jl by reading the documentation or watching the following video:\n\nThe following code uses DrWatson.jl to activate the environment for this project which is named biomath_2024:\n\n\nShow the code\n# import DrWatson.jl package\nusing DrWatson\n\n# activate the biomath_2024 environment\n@quickactivate \"biomath_2024\"\n\n\n[ Info: Precompiling DrWatson [634d3b9d-ee7a-5ddf-bec9-22491ea816e1]\n\n\nNow that we have activated our environment, we can use the package manager Pkg.jl to see which packages are installed in the environment and their versions:\n\n\nShow the code\n# import Pkg.jl package\nimport Pkg\n# list packages installed in environment\nPkg.status()\n\n\nStatus `~/Documents/GitHub/biomath_2024/Project.toml`\n⌃ [13f3f980] CairoMakie v0.11.4\n  [a93c6f00] DataFrames v1.6.1\n⌃ [0c46a032] DifferentialEquations v7.12.0\n⌃ [31c24e10] Distributions v0.25.104\n⌅ [5b8099bc] DomainSets v0.6.7\n⌃ [634d3b9d] DrWatson v2.13.0\n⌃ [61744808] DynamicalSystems v3.2.3\n  [b964fa9f] LaTeXStrings v1.3.1\n⌃ [94925ecb] MethodOfLines v0.10.4\n⌅ [961ee093] ModelingToolkit v8.75.0\n⌅ [8913a72c] NonlinearSolve v3.4.0\n⌃ [429524aa] Optim v1.7.8\n⌃ [7f7a1694] Optimization v3.20.2\n⌅ [1dea7af3] OrdinaryDiffEq v6.66.0\n⌅ [91a5bcdd] Plots v1.39.0\n⌃ [f2b01f46] Roots v2.0.22\n⌅ [0c5d862f] Symbolics v5.14.0\nInfo Packages marked with ⌃ and ⌅ have new versions available.

To see why use `status --outdated`\n\n\nThe nice thing about working with Julia environments is that we can easily share the environment with others. The Project.toml and Manifest.toml files contain all the information needed to recreate the environment. If you download the project folder for biomath_2024 from the GitHub repository, then all you have to do is:\n\nStart Julia in the biomath_2024 folder which contains the Project.toml and Manifest.toml files.\nActivate the environment using DrWatson.jl as shown above.\nRun the instatiate command in the package manager to install all the packages listed in the Project.toml file1.\n\nSome of the packages most relevant for solving problems in biomathematics include:\n\nPlots.jl for plotting.\nDifferentialEquations.jl for numerical computing with differential equations.\nMethodOfLines.jl for numerical computing with partial differential equations."

    "text": "R\nR is a programming language developed for statistical computing (R Core Team 2023). You can learn more about the history of R here. For programming in R, we highly recommend using the RStudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to interface with the language.\nSome very useful resources for getting started in R include:\n\nFast Lane to Learning R - This site is for those who know nothing of R, and maybe even nothing of programming, and seek QUICK, PAINLESS! entree to the world of R.\nswirl - Learn R, in R.\n\n\nFunctions and Packages\nMost of the algorithms and methods we will want to use in solving problems in biomathematics are implemented as functions in R. Base R contains a number of functions including many that are useful for scientific computing. For example, base R contains a function sin that implements the mathematical function \\(\\sin(x)\\). It is called as follows:\n\nsin(pi/4)\n\n[1] 0.7071068\n\n\nHowever, most of the functions we will use are not in base R but rather are contained in packages. A package is a collection of functions and other objects that can be loaded into R and used. There are thousands of packages available for R. You can find a list of packages on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) or on Bioconductor. Some packages that we will use a lot in the course include:\n\ntidyverse - a collection of packages for data science (Wickham et al. 2019). The tidyverse package itself is a meta-package that loads a number of other packages including ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble, stringr, and forcats. Of these, ggplot2 is of great interest because it is used for creating high-quality plots and visualization (Wickham 2016).\ndeSolve - a package for numerical computing with differential equations (Karline Soetaert, Thomas Petzoldt, and R. Woodrow Setzer 2010).\nrootSolve - a package for root finding (Karline Soetaert 2009).\nReacTran - a package for numerical computing with partial differential equations equations (Soetaert and Meysman 2012).\nphaseR - a package for phase plane analysis (Grayling 2014).\n\nAfter you have installed these packages, you can load them into R using the library function1. For example, to load the packages listed above, you would use the following code:\n\n\nShow the code\n# load packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(deSolve)\nlibrary(rootSolve)\nlibrary(ReacTran)\nlibrary(phaseR)\nlibrary(latex2exp)\nlibrary(patchwork)"

    "text": "Python\nPython is an elegant an mature general-purpose programming language (Van Rossum and Drake 2009). You can learn more about the history of Python here.\n\nFunctions and Modules\nAs in R, most of the algorithms and methods we will want to use in solving problems in biomathematics are implemented as functions in Python. However, base Python contains very few functions useful for mathematics or scientific computing. Most of the functions we will need are contained in modules. A module is a collection of functions and other objects that can be imported into Python. There are many modules available for scientific computing in Python. We will focus on a few of the most commonly used ones such as\n\nNumPy: Numerical Python, offers comprehensive mathematical functions, random number generators, linear algebra routines, Fourier transforms, and more.\nSciPy: Scientific Python, provides algorithms for optimization, integration, interpolation, eigenvalue problems, algebraic equations, differential equations, statistics and many other classes of problems.\nMatplotlib: Plotting in Python, is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.\nSymPy: Symbolic Python, is a library for symbolic mathematics.\npy-pde: py-pde is a python package providing methods and classes useful for solving partial differential equations (PDEs).\n\nOne thing that is a little different working in Python (and also Julia) compared to R is that it’s common practice to utilize virtual environments to avoid conflicts between functions and objects from different modules. Environments also help keep track of different versions of the Python interpreter. We will not go into details about how to use environments here, but we will provide some links to resources that explain how to use them.\n\n\nEnvinronment Setup\nThe most common tool in the scientific community for managing Python environments is Conda. Conda is a package manager that can be used to install Python and other software packages. It can also be used to create and manage virtual environments. Conda is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. You can download and install Conda from here. To learn about using Conda, see the following video:\n\nMaster the basics of Conda environments in Python YouTube video, watch video on YouTube.\n\n\nThe nice thing about working with virtual environments is that we can easily share the environment with others. To do this, we can create a file called environment.yml that contains a list of all the packages we want to install in the environment. For example, the environment.yml file from the GitHub repository will create an environment called biomath_py that contains Python 3.9 and the NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and SymPy modules among others.\nOnce we have set up and activated the environment, we can import modules and use functions from them. For example, to import the NumPy module and compute \\(\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\), we can use the following code:\n\nfrom numpy import sin, pi\n\nsin(pi/4)\n\n0.7071067811865475"

    "text": "An Example\n\nGeneral Model of Inflammation\nInflammation is a normal part of the immune response for defense against invasion by foreign cells or molecules. However, inflammation may become chronic and lead to disease, sepsis, and even death. For the purposes of both treatment and prevention of disease, it is important to understand the conditions that lead to chronic inflammation.\nWithout going into the biological and chemical details, we know that inflammation is controlled and mediated by immune cells (the macrophage) whose behavior is regulated by signaling molecules known as cytokines. Thus, it is reasonable for the purposes of abstraction to encapsulate the immune response by the activities of macrophage cells, cytokines, and an invading body such as a bacteria cell. This is exactly what is done in the paper (Herald 2010).\nFigure 1 shows a schematic corresponding to our abstraction of the immune response. The macrophage cell population responds to bacterial invasion and produces cytokines that mediate the immune response. The exact details of the interactions are governed by model parameters and mathematical relationships between the interacting cell populations and cytokines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Schematic of inflammation model. This corresponds roughly to Figure 1 in (Herald 2010).\n\n\n\nIn (Herald 2010), the author converts the model diagram into a mathematical model in the form of a coupled system of nonlinear differential equations shown here:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{dM}{dt} &= s + \\frac{r C}{1 + k_{1} C} - m_{d} M, \\\\\n\\frac{dC}{dt} &=  p_{c} B M + M \\frac{a C}{(1 + k_{2} C)}\\frac{1}{(1 + k_{3} A)} - c_{d} C,\\\\\n\\frac{dA}{dt} &=  p_{a} C M - a_{d} A, \\\\\n\\frac{dB}{dt} &= g B - b_{d} M B.\n\\end{align}\\]\nNote that\n\n\\(M\\) - macrophage cell population\n\\(C\\) - inflammatory cytokine concentration\n\\(A\\) - anti-inflammatory cytokine concentration\n\\(B\\) - bacteria cell population\n\nIn the paper, the author uses the model equations to show that under a certain set of circumstances a bacterial pathogen will not provide a sufficient trigger to cause chronic inflammation. On the other hand, if conditions are right, even a minor bacterial infection can lead to chronic inflammation. Notice that this example contains all of the components of the basic biomathematical work flow:\n\nThe real world phenomenon of interest from the life sciences is inflammation.\nFigure 1 corresponds to an abstraction of the biochemical details of the immune system highlighting what is thought to be the essential features of the inflammatory response.\nClearly there is a mathematical model. Soon we will discuss further how one might come up with such a system of equations. These were not simply pulled out of thin air.\nIn (Herald 2010), the author uses techniques from dynamical systems and bifurcation theory in order to derive useful information from the model equations.\nThe author’s analysis of the model system explains some aspects of inflammation and pinpoints conditions that lead to chronic inflammation. The author’s work also explains why certain therapies for chronic inflammation are not successful.\n\nThere are still many questions about inflammation to be addressed beyond what is done in (Herald 2010). However, in order to make progress more details of the immune response may need to be included. This will involve either modifying the system of equations displayed in this section, or using a different mathematical model altogether. For now, the point to take away is that, often times, this is how work in biomathematics proceeds.\nLet’s spend some time discussing the process of modeling in more detail."

    "section": "Modeling",
    "text": "Modeling\n\nWhat is a Mathematical Model?\nBefore we begin to address the question of what is a mathematical model, let’s spend some time on not-necessarily-mathematical models. Work in science and engineering often proceeds by employing models. What is a model? Consider the following quotation:\n\nA model is a rendition of a reality which is often too difficult or impossible to handle directly. A model is always a simplification, and a good model is one that captures the essential features of reality, leaving the unessential out (Calvetti and Somersalo 2013).\n\nA great example of a scientific model is the Bohr model for the atom. This model posits that an atom is made up of a small dense nucleus surrounded by orbiting electrons. This is a model because it does not include many atomic and nuclear details. It is a useful model because it leads to an explanation of certain chemical properties of atoms that could not be derived prior to the use of the Bohr model. Many biologists use model organisms to investigate the biological world. For example, people interested in understanding the evolution of social behavior study specific species of ants or bees. These insects are used because they are relatively easy to keep in a lab or to observe in nature and are also easy to manipulate experimentally. The use of animal models is also widespread in the study of disease and drug therapies.\nA mathematical model plays a similar role to models in the more general sense that we just described, but as you might imagine mathematical models are formulated and implemented mathematically. We’ve already seen many examples of mathematical models. Let’s look at another example of a mathematical model, this time one coming from physics that is likely familiar to you from a course in ordinary differential equations.\nPhysics and mechanics in particular is often interested in the motion of a point particle. (Notice that point particles are an abstraction from reality.) Newton’s laws tell us, among other things, that the sum of all forces acting on a mass is proportional to the acceleration of the object. Furthermore, the constant of proportionality is the mass. In notation, we have that \\(F=ma\\). Now, while \\(F=ma\\) is an equation and you could reasonably argue that it is a “mathematical model” for how the physical world works, \\(F=ma\\) is not really representative of what we mean by a mathematical model in most instances. The reason is that it is a general statement, a theory and not a reference to something specific. However, we can use \\(F=ma\\) to construct mathematical models in more specific situations.\nSuppose for example that we are concerned with the motion of a particle of mass \\(m\\) attached to a spring. We can model the total force that is applied to the mass by the spring via the equation \\(F=-kx\\). This says that the force due to the spring is linearly proportional to the displacement of the mass from it’s equilibrium (resting) position. (Again, this is an abstraction from reality.) The constant of proportionality \\(k\\) is called the spring constant. It encodes physical properties of a spring such as its stiffness. Taken together with \\(F=ma\\) and using that acceleration is the second derivative of displacement we arrive at a mathematical model\n\\(\\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = -\\frac{k}{m}x.\\)\nThis is a model because it is based on several abstractions from reality and ignores some details such as more fine-grained details about the material properties of real-world springs. It also assumes an ideal situation where there is no friction.\nAs you have seen in a differential equations course by using standard methods it can be deduced based on the form of the equation \\(\\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = -\\frac{k}{m}x\\) that such a mass will oscillate with a fixed period and frequency determined by the values for \\(k\\) and \\(m\\). This leads us to another important point. There are several levels of “variable” involved in the model \\(\\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = -\\frac{k}{m}x\\). There is the independent variable \\(t\\) for time, the dependent variable for the unknown displacement \\(x\\) (the quantity we are ultimately most interested in), and there are the parameters \\(k\\) and \\(m\\).\nThe last example provides some insight into mathematical modeling, that is, the process of constructing or deriving a model. We begin with an abstraction from reality that represents those parts of the world in which we are most interested in, then we specify quantities that we want to relate, establish mathematical notation, and finally write down an equation that becomes our mathematical model. While our last example was very simple (too simple), it still serves to highlight the modeling process. The next section elaborates on this.\n\n\nMathematical Modeling\nIt is important to realize two facts about mathematical modeling, especially in the context of biomathematics, from the start:\n\nMathematical modeling is as much art as it is science. The point is that mathematical modeling is not routine or algorithmic. Successful modeling requires creativity and intuition developed through experience.\nMathematical modeling will almost certainly involve repeated refinements. Unless there is a very strong reason to do otherwise, it’s best to start with the simplest possible reasonable model, even at the risk of oversimplification. If the model produces incorrect or inaccurate results relative to the problem of interest, then the model can be revised in order to fix what is glaringly wrong.\n\n\n\nModeling Process\nHere is a conceptual outline of the modeling process in the form of a series of steps that one typically carries out during the course of the modeling process.\n\nFormulate the question or state your problem. Explicitly write down assumptions and what is known about the system that you want to develop a model for.\nIdentify key quantities and define variables and parameters of interest. At this stage you should take careful note of the units of measurement that are associated with all of the model variables and parameters.\nDevelop a qualitative description of your model. Use diagrams or word equations to describe the relationships between variables. In the next lecture we will discuss compartment modeling which is a commonly used method for organizing the processes and interactions of variables in a way that helps one to more easily write down model equations.\nWrite down model equations corresponding to the qualitative description in the previous step. Perform dimensional analysis (covered in detail later) to make sure that there are no inconsistencies in your equations regarding units. At this stage it is very helpful to construct a table that lists all of the variables and parameters appearing in the model. The table should include the units of measurement for all of the variables and parameters as well as any specific parameters values that are known from experiment or the existing literature.\nNondimensionalize the model. This is a process founded on the Buckingham \\(\\pi\\) theorem in which variables and parameters are rescaled to remove units. This process is extremely important as it often simplifies the model by reducing the number of parameters and pinpoints the most significant parameters (or parameter combinations) in the model.\n\nAt this stage you will be ready to analyze or implement your model in order to obtain results such as qualitative or quantitative predictions. The next thing to do is determine if the model results are consistent with known information or experimental results. You have to do something to decide if your model is successful or should be revised in order to address your starting question or solve the problem you have posed.\nWith this overview in hand, the next lecture will cover compartment modeling and we will start to see concrete examples of mathematical models and the modeling process."
