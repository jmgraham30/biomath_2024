## Overview

Scientific computing software plays a major role in biomathematics for many reasons some of which include:

* The complexity of biological systems leads to models or equations that are difficult to work with analytically but can be handled by numerical methods. 

* The need to synthesize theoretical models and data from experiments.

* Graphs and visualizations are important for understanding and communicating scientific results.

* Computing allows us to use theoretical models to conduct experiments [*in silico*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_silico) that would be difficult or impossible to conduct otherwise. 

Thus, this course will make use of scientific computing software. Three commonly used languages for scientific computing in biomathematics are [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Julia](https://julialang.org/), and [Python](https://www.python.org/). In this course, we will mostly use R, but it's worth knowing at least a little about scientific computing in all three languages as each of them has its own strengths and weaknesses in the context of scientific computing for biomathematics. The goal is not to become an expert in any of these languages, but rather to become familiar with the basics of each language and to learn how to use them to solve problems in biomathematics. 

This page will focus on Julia. The other two languages have their own pages:

* [R for Biomathematics](https://biomath2024.netlify.app/biomath_r)

* [Python for Biomathematics](https://biomath2024.netlify.app/biomath_python)

Each of these pages will have a similar structure to this one. We do not provide details on or even an introduction to the basic of programming or the structure of any of the languages. There are many resources available for learning these things. Instead, we focus on providing some concise examples of the use of these languages for scientific computing in biomathematics. The hope is that the reader will be able to copy and modify these examples to solve their own problems.


The section titles listed in the table of contents for the page should indicate the topics or types of problems we provide examples for. For some of the more involved code, we provide links to additional webpages that provide more details. In some cases, we provide links to potentially helpful videos or web sites where the reader can learn more.
