# Course Syllabus

Welcome to MATH 463 *Topics in Biomathematics* for Spring 2024! This page contains the syllabus for the course. We begin with a brief description of biomathematics, followed by information about the instructor, course materials, and course policies.

## What is Biomathematics? 

[Biomathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_and_theoretical_biology#:~:text=Mathematical%20and%20theoretical%20biology%2C%20or,opposed%20to%20experimental%20biology%20which) is concerned with the use of mathematical methods (*e.g.*, linear algebra, differential equations, dynamical systems, and probability theory) to understand phenomenon in the life sciences, it is part of the larger field of [mathematical and theoretical biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_and_theoretical_biology#:~:text=Mathematical%20and%20theoretical%20biology%20is,biology%20which%20deals%20with%20the). Mathematical and theoretical biology provide a solid foundation for computational and quantitative approaches to investigations in biology and medicine.

### Use of Digital Technology

Work and research in Biomathematics requires professionals in the field to make use of digital technology. The primary uses of digital technology in Biomathematics is for producing and importing data, scientific computing, visualization of data and model-based simulations, and preparing written documents to explain mathematical results. Two of the most commonly used technological tools are R for scientific computing and $\LaTeX$ for written document preparation. Students in this course will be expected to use R, and $\LaTeX$.  R can be installed to any platform via the downloads available [here](https://www.r-project.org/). R is best used with the integrative development environment RStudio which can be installed from [here](https://www.rstudio.com/). 

### Use of AI

Artificial intelligence (AI) can be an effective tool in science. For example, AI-based programming assistants like [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) or generative model platforms like [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) now help programmers and developers to write better code in less time. Learning to use AI is essentially becoming a basic skill for the modern scientist. Because of this, I do not want to completely discourage the use of AI assistance. 

However, I ask that you avoid using AI platforms or tools in a manner that is inappropriate in the context of this course. This course teaches a variety of concepts, skills, and critical thinking. Using AI in such a way as to avoid learning, developing skills, or critical thinking is not appropriate. If you find yourself using AI to look up answers, search for complete solutions to problems, or things like this, then your use of AI is not acceptable. It might be helpful to think of AI as an analog to a calculator. If the goal of an assignment is for you to demonstrate that you can do a certain calculation, then using a calculator is not appropriate. On the other hand, if the goal of an assignment is for you to demonstrate that you can solve a problem for which a minor step involves doing a calculation, then using a calculator is okay. AI should be treated analogously.   

In particular, it is expected that students will be able to explain independently and in detail what any line of code submitted as part of an assignment this semester does. Also, it is expected that students can explain independently and in detail the solution to any problem submitted as part of an assignment this semester.  

If you have any doubts about your use of AI, then either ask the instructor if your use of AI is acceptable or just don't use AI.



## Assignments

### Homework

There will be weekly homework assignments. Assignments will be posted on the course learning management system and made up of problems relating to or extending the material covered in class discussions.  Working problems is essential to learning the material and doing well on exams. 

Do not underestimate the value (and joy) of carefully working through homework problems.


### Exams

The in-class exams are meant to assess  1) students' understanding of the material covered in class and in homework assignments, 2) students' understanding of the core concepts, 3) students' problem solving abilities, and 4) students' ability to think independently. Exam 1 is scheduled for March 6, and Exam 2 is scheduled for May 1. In writing the tests, I assume that you have been studying the material at least 6 hours per week outside of class. 

### Model Report

As part of the required coursework for *Topics in Biomathematics*, students are asked to submit a model report. The goal of this assignment is for students to read, understand, assess, and explain modeling results from a recently published paper in theoretical or quantitative biology or biomathematics. The model report will make up 10% of the course grade. Students must submit at least two drafts of a model report. A model report should be four to five typed pages and prepared using $\LaTeX$ or [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).  The first draft is due March 25 and the final draft is due May 3. A set of guidelines for the model report can be found on the course learning management system.



### Final Project

It should be recognized that the mathematical techniques developed in class are applicable in broader situations than can be covered in lectures and homework. Thus, students are asked to individually explore a topic in biomathematics beyond what is covered in lecture by means of a final project. Final projects should be an 8-12 page manuscript prepared using $\LaTeX$ or [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/),  and students must submit at least two drafts of their written final projects. The final draft is **due no later than 5:00pm on Wednesday May 15.** All written and presented work must be original, explained in your own words, and use proper citation for works referenced. 

A set of guidelines for the final project is posted on the course learning management system. **You must choose a topic for your final project and submit a one to two paragraph description of your proposed project along with at least two scholarly references to me no later than 5:00pm on March 1.**

### Academic Honesty and Integrity

Each student is expected to do their own work. It is also expected that each student respect and abide by the Academic Code of Honesty as set forth in the University of Scranton student handbook. Conduct that violates the Academic Code of Honesty includes plagiarism, duplicate submission of the same work, collusion, providing false information, unauthorized use of computers, theft and destruction of property, and unauthorized possession of tests and other materials. Steps taken in response to suspected violations may include a discussion with the instructor, an informal meeting with the dean of the college, and a hearing before the Academic Dishonesty Hearing Board. Students  who are found to have violated the Code will ordinarily be assigned the grade F by the instructor and may face other sanctions. The complete Academic Code of Honesty is located on the University website at <https://www.scranton.edu/academics/wml/acad-integ/acad-code-honesty.shtml>. 

### My Reporting Obligation as a Responsible Employee

As a faculty member, I am deeply invested in the well-being of each student I teach. I am here to assist you with your work in this course. Additionally, if you come to me with other non-course-related concerns, I will do my best to help. It is important for you to know that all faculty members are required to report incidents of sexual harassment or sexual misconduct involving students. This means that I cannot keep information about sexual harassment, sexual assault, sexual exploitation, intimate partner violence or stalking confidential if you share that information with me. I will keep the information as private as I can but am required to bring it to the attention of the University’s Title IX Coordinator, Elizabeth M. Garcia, or Deputy Title IX Coordinator, Diana M. Collins, who, in conversation with you, will explain available support, resources, and options. I will not report anything to anybody without first letting you know and discussing choices as to how to proceed. The University’s Counseling Center (570-941-7620) is available to you as a confidential resource; counselors (in the counseling center) do not have an obligation to report to the Title IX Coordinator.

### Non-discrimination Statement

The University of Scranton Sexual Harassment and Sexual Misconduct Policy can be found online at <https://www.scranton.edu/diversity>. All reporting options and resources are available at <https://www.scranton.edu/CARE>. 

### About Pronouns

It is easy to make assumptions about an individual's pronouns, but we try not to! Please tell us in class or via a private email if you would like to let us know what your pronouns are, if/when you would like us (and others) to use them, and certainly feel free to correct us or others if we make a mistake. Using the pronouns that a person has indicated they prefer is considered both professional and polite, and as such we ask that all members of our class use the appropriate pronouns.

If you have questions about this, please feel free to look up more information here (<https://www.mypronouns.org/>) or email <jason.graham@scranton.edu> with any questions.

### Student Mental Health: Suggestions and Resources

Many students experience mental health challenges at some point in college. Struggles vary and might be related to academics, anxiety, depression, relationships, grief/loss, substance abuse, and other challenges. There are resources to help you and getting help is the smart and courageous thing to do.
